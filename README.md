Project Overview
The Road Accident Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of road accident statistics, including trends over time, accident severity, types of collisions, contributing factors, and accident locations. The dashboard is designed to support decision-makers in identifying and understanding accident hotspots, time-based trends, and other key risk factors, ultimately aiding in reducing accidents and improving road safety.

Data Source
The dataset used in this dashboard was sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on various aspects of road accidents, such as:

Accident location (latitude and longitude)
Date and time of accident occurrence
Severity levels
Types of collisions
Contributing factors (e.g., weather, road conditions)
Demographic information of drivers (where available)
Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes the following main features:

Trend Analysis: A time-series visualization showing accident trends over months/years.
Heat Map: Displays accident hotspots based on geographic data.
Severity Analysis: Breaks down accident severity levels (e.g., minor, severe, fatal).
Factor Analysis: Analyzes factors contributing to accidents, such as weather, road conditions, and time of day.
Demographic Distribution: Visualizes age group and gender distribution of individuals involved in accidents.
Insights and Key Findings
The dashboard provides valuable insights, such as:

High-accident zones and patterns over time.
Influence of external factors like weather and road conditions on accident frequency.
Identification of accident-prone times during the day and high-risk age groups.
Installation
To view and interact with this dashboard locally or on a server:

Ensure Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public is installed on your machine.
